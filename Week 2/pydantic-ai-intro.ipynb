Here’s a concise guide on how to do this:\\n\\n### Overview\\nYou will evaluate text based on custom criteria using an LLM as a judge, and also assess the performance of the LLM evaluator itself. This involves two main types of evaluations:\\n- **Reference-based**: Compare new responses against a predefined reference (approved responses).\\n- **Open-ended**: Evaluate responses against custom criteria, which is useful when no reference is available.\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n- Basic knowledge of Python.\\n- An OpenAI API key.\\n\\n### Setup\\n1. **Installation**:\\n   Make sure to install the required package:\\n   ```bash\\n   pip install evidently\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Import Modules**:\\n   You need to import the necessary modules in Python:\\n   ```python\\n   import pandas as pd\\n   import numpy as np\\n   from evidently import Dataset, DataDefinition, Report\\n   from evidently.llm.templates import BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Set OpenAI Key**:\\n   Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:\\n   ```python\\n   import os\\n   os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"YOUR_KEY\"\\n   ```\\n\\n### Create Evaluation Dataset\\nYou will need to create a dataset with questions, target responses, new responses, and manual labels:\\n```python\\ndata = [\\n    # Example dataset entries...\\n]\\ncolumns = [\"question\", \"target_response\", \"new_response\", \"label\", \"comment\"]\\ngolden_dataset = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)\\n\\ndefinition = DataDefinition(\\n    text_columns=[\"question\", \"target_response\", \"new_response\"],\\n    categorical_columns=[\"label\"]\\n)\\n\\neval_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(\\n    golden_dataset,\\n    data_definition=definition\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Configure LLM Evaluator\\n1. **Set Up the Evaluator Prompt**:\\n   Configure the prompt template for evaluating correctness:\\n   ```python\\n   correctness = BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate(\\n       criteria=\"An ANSWER is correct when it is the same as the REFERENCE in all facts and details.\",\\n       target_category=\"incorrect\",\\n       non_target_category=\"correct\",\\n       uncertainity=\"unknown\",\\n       include_reasoning=True,\\n       pre_messages=[(\"system\", \"You are an expert evaluator. You will be given an ANSWER and REFERENCE\")]\\n   )\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Evaluate Responses**:\\n   Add the evaluator to the dataset:\\n   ```python\\n   eval_dataset.add_descriptors(descriptors=[\\n       LLMEval(\"new_response\",\\n               template=correctness,\\n               provider=\"openai\",\\n               model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n               alias=\"Correctness\",\\n               additional_columns={\"target_response\": \"target_response\"})\\n   ])\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Generate Reports**:\\n   Create a report to see the results:\\n   ```python\\n   report = Report([TextEvals()])\\n   my_eval = report.run(eval_dataset, None)\\n   my_eval\\n   ```\\n\\n### Evaluate the LLM Evaluator Quality\\nYou can assess the quality of the LLM judge by treating the evaluation as a binary classification task and generating a confusion matrix.\\n\\n### Verbosity Evaluation\\nYou may also create a simpler evaluator focusing on the verbosity of responses. The steps are similar, but you would adjust the prompt template to check for conciseness instead of correctness.\\n\\n### Next Steps\\nFor advanced integration, consider using the Evidently Cloud platform to systematically track your evaluation results.\\n\\nThis tutorial provides comprehensive steps to efficiently run an LLM as a judge for evaluations, leveraging the [Evidently](https://github.com/evidentlyai/docs/blob/main/examples/LLM_judge.mdx) library. \\n\\nExplore the full example in the [documentation](https://github.com/evidentlyai/docs/blob/main/examples/LLM_judge.mdx) for more details and additional functionalities.')>"

Evaluate the LLM Eval quality\\\\n\\\\nThis part is a bit meta: we\\'re going to evaluate the quality of our LLM evaluator itself\\\\\\\\! We can treat it as a simple **binary classification** problem.\\\\n\\\\n**Data definition**. To evaluate the classification quality, we need to map the structure of the dataset accordingly first. The column with the manual label is the \\\\\"target\\\\\", and the LLM-judge response is the \\\\\"prediction\\\\\":\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\ndf=eval_dataset.as_dataframe()\\\\n\\\\ndefinition_2 = DataDefinition(\\\\n    classification=[BinaryClassification(\\\\n        target=\\\\\"label\\\\\",\\\\n        prediction_labels=\\\\\"Correctness\\\\\",\\\\n        pos_label = \\\\\"incorrect\\\\\")],\\\\n    categorical_columns=[\\\\\"label\\\\\", \\\\\"Correctness\\\\\"])\\\\n\\\\nclass_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(\\\\n    pd.DataFrame(df),\\\\n    data_definition=definition_2)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n  `Pos_label` refers to the class that is treated as the target (\\\\\"what we want to predict better\\\\\") for metrics like precision, recall, F1-score.\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\n**Get a Report**. Let\\'s use a`ClassificationPreset()` that combines several classification metrics:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nreport = Report([\\\\n    ClassificationPreset()\\\\n])\\\\n\\\\nmy_eval = report.run(class_dataset, None)\\\\nmy_eval\\\\n\\\\n# or my_eval.as_dict()\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWe can now get a well-rounded evaluation and explore the confusion matrix. We have one type of error each: overall the results are pretty good\\\\\\\\! You can also refine the prompt to try to improve them.\\\\n\\\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_conf_matrix-min.png)\\\\n\\\\n## 5. Verbosity evaluator\\\\n\\\\nNext, let\\\\u2019s create a simpler verbosity judge. It will check whether the responses are concise and to the point. This only requires evaluating one output column: such checks are perfect for production evaluations where you don\\\\u2019t have a reference answer.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s ho\",\\n    \"title\": \"LLM as a judge\",\\n    \"description\": \"How to create and evaluate an LLM judge.\",\\n    \"filename\": \"examples/LLM_judge.mdx\"\\n  }\\n]'}</pre>\n",
